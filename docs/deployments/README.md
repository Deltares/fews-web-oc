# Delft-FEWS Web OC Deployments

The Delft-FEWS Web OC is distributed as a single page web application.
When deployed to a server like Nginx or Tomcat it is required to make sure that all requests are mapped to the index.html page of the web oc.
This means that the server will have to redirect all HTTP 404 errors to the index.html. How this is described will be explained in per deployment.
